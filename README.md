## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

### Steps made to optimize web-page:
- In main.js file, following Udacity instructor's reccomendations, I optimized function changePizzaSizes, removed unneccesery code (lines 430-451).
- function updatePositions, which caused bottleneck, was optimaized (lines 491-499).
- used ngrok to measure performacne of page on with Page Speed Insights which was initially very low: onlu 27-29 points.
